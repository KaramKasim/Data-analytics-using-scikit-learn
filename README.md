Let’s Dive into the concept--------------------------------------->
Suppose V-mart is a e-commerce company located in the heart of Kolkata city. They sell clothes online, but also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers walk into these sessions, meet with a personal stylist, then go back home and place orders for clothing. Orders are placed either on the company’s mobile app or on their website.

Now suppose V-mart hire a as a data scientist to take a business decision.

  Here is the question they want answered:

  "Should we focus our efforts more on the mobile app or on the website?"

To help you make this decision, the company has provided you with a CSV file that contains statistics on how each customer uses their mobile app and their website.
